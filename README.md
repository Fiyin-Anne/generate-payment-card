### ðŸš€ Getting started
Install the package from npm using `npm install generate-payment-card`.

### ðŸ§° Basic usage
```javascript
var { generate } = require('generate-payment-card')
var payment_card_details = generate({
    "card_brand": "american express",
    "user_digits": {
        "status": true,
        "digits": 2345678991,
        "position": "endswith"
    }
})

console.log(payment_card_details)
/* outputs:

The `generate` function takes in one argument which is an object containing a card_brand (string), user_digits (object) and `issuer` (string).
- `card_brand`: This is the card brand that the user would like to generate a payment card from. Currently, this package is only able to generate Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover cards.
- `user_digits`: The user can specify a sequence of not more or less than ten digits which they want to be a part of the payment card number. They can also specify where they want this sequence to be placed by setting `position` to `startswith`, `contains` or `endswith`. This object accepts three keys:
    - `status`: which shows if the user will be specifying their own sequence of digits. This key's property can either be `true`, `false`, 'yes`, or `no`.
    - `digits`: This is the sequence of 10 digits that the user provides.
    - `position`: This indicates where the user wants the digits to be placed in the the generated card numbers.
- `issuer`: This is the specific organization that the user wants the card to be generated from.
