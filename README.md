The generator takes in one argument which is a json payload containing a card_brand (string) and user_digits (object).
- `card_brand`: This is the card brand that the user would like to generate a payment card from. Currently this package is only able to generate mastercard, visa, American Express and Discover cards.
- `user_digits`: The user can specify a sequence of not more or less than ten digits which they want to be a part of the payment card number. They can also specify where they want this sequence to be placed by setting `position` to either `startswith`, `contains` or `endswith`.
